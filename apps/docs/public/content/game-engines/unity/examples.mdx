### Simple Example
import Preview from '../../../src/app/components/preview'

Use `WASD` or `Arrow keys` to move the player around. The player's position is synced with other players in real-time.

Code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-docs/tree/main/examples/unity-hello-world).

<Preview src="/demos/unity/index.html" newWindow />

### Beanz: Discord Activity Demo

Once built, this demo works on both WebGL in the browser, and in [Discord Activities](/components/discord).

Code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/asadm/playroom-unity/tree/main/Assets/PlayroomKit/Examples/discord-activity).
