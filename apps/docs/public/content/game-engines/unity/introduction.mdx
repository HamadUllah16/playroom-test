1. Download the PlayroomKit Unity package from the dashboard
2. Import the package into your Unity project
3. Configure your API keys in the PlayroomKit settings

## Quick Setup

```csharp
using PlayroomKit;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        // Initialize PlayroomKit
        Playroom.Init("your-api-key", () => {
            Debug.Log("PlayroomKit initialized!");
        });
    }
}
```

## Features

- **Real-time multiplayer** - Synchronize game state across players
- **Player management** - Handle player connections and disconnections
- **Room system** - Create and manage game rooms
- **State synchronization** - Keep game objects in sync

## Examples

### Creating a Room

```csharp
Playroom.CreateRoom(new RoomOptions {
    maxPlayers = 4,
    roomCode = "GAME123"
}, (room) => {
    Debug.Log($"Room created: {room.code}");
});
```

### Joining a Room

```csharp
Playroom.JoinRoom("GAME123", (success) => {
    if (success) {
        Debug.Log("Successfully joined room!");
    }
});
```

### Player State Synchronization

```csharp
public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Update()
    {
        if (Playroom.IsMyPlayer(playerId))
        {
            // Update position for this player
            Playroom.SetPlayerState(playerId, "position", transform.position);
        }
        else
        {
            // Sync position from other players
            Vector3 networkPosition = Playroom.GetPlayerState<Vector3>(playerId, "position");
            transform.position = Vector3.Lerp(transform.position, networkPosition, Time.deltaTime * 10f);
        }
    }
}
```
