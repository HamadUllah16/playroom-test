This currently works with **Browser Bridge mock mode** only.

To test with multiple players:

1. Ensure the latest version of the [PlayroomKit plugin](/usage/unity#1-install-the-sdk) is installed.
2. Open the [Playroom Dev Manager](./playroom-dev-manager) panel in Unity.
3. Click "Launch player" to create a new Unity Editor instance.
4. Repeat step 3 for additional player instances (limited by your computer's resources).

This feature uses [ParrelSync](https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync) Unity Editor to create multiple Unity Editor clones, each representing a different player.

    **Tip:** Use this method to simulate various multiplayer scenarios and test synchronization between players without deploying your game.

By utilizing both Mock Modes and the Multiple Player testing feature, you can thoroughly test your game's multiplayer functionality and performance within the Unity environment before proceeding to a full WebGL build.
