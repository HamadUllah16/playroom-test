title: Mock Mode
description: Test PlayroomKit games in Unity Editor using Mock Modes.
---

Since the current SDK only supports Unity Web, we've introduced **Mock mode** - a way to test out your game's logic in Unity's Preview mode, without having to build for web every single time.

#### 1. Local (simulated)
The "Local" mock mode doesn't connect to the actual Playroom servers. Instead, it just mocks the API calls within Unity, and maintains a local state.

**The "Local" Mock mode only works in single player mode for now.** We aim to make it multiplayer by Q4.

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Super fast                                                             | There may be inconsistencies                       |
| Not much setup, lightweight                                            | Can't benchmark network load/bandwidth             |
| Can work offline                                                       | Doesn't have multiplayer (yet), single-player only                                                    |
| No impact on Playroom bill                                             |                                                      |


#### 2. Browser Bridge (live)

<div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'row', alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'start', gap: '0.3rem'}}>Status: <div style={{background: 'blue', color: 'white', width: 'fit-content', margin: '1rem 0'}}>Beta</div></div>

This mode connects to a live, multiplayer Playroom server **in the cloud**. It will make real network calls, but to do so, it will launch a controlled browser (to run the underlying network calls).

| **✅ Pros**                                                                 | **👎 Cons**                                             |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Live on Playroom servers, testers can join in from live games                        | Takes time to set up                               |
| Completely accurate according to production                           | Network dependent (can't develop offline)          |
|                                                                          | It may eat up your Playroom bill                  |


##### Setting up the Browser Bridge mock mode

Follow these steps to set up **Browser Bridge mock mode** for your project. 

###### Step 1: Enable Browser Bridge Mock Mode  
1. In the **Playroom Dev Manager**, locate the "Mock mode" dropdown.
2. Select **"Browser Bridge (live)"** from the available options.

###### Step 2: Download and Set Up the Chrome Driver  
Browser Bridge mock mode requires a Chrome browser to run alongside the Unity Editor. You must install the appropriate ChromeDriver version matching your browser.

1. Identify your Chrome version.  
   - You can check this in your browser settings. Refer to [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads) for help.  
2. Download the corresponding ChromeDriver version from [Google's Chrome for Testing page](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable).  
3. Place the ChromeDriver in an accessible location on your machine.  

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Avoid adding the ChromeDriver to version control, as team members may use different browser versions. Each developer should maintain their own compatible version.
</Callout>

###### Step 3: Configure the Web Driver Path  
1. In the Unity project hierarchy, select **"UnityBrowserBridge"**.

2. In the "Inspector" panel on the right, locate **"Unity Browser Bridge (Script)"**.  
3. Update the **"Web Driver Directory"** field with the path to your ChromeDriver file.

###### Step 4: Update Paths for *nix Systems (if applicable)  
For macOS or Linux, update the **"Include JavaScript Files"** path in the "Element 0" field with the correct syntax for your system.  

<Callout type='info' emoji="ℹ️">
Different operating systems use different path separators. Ensure your paths are formatted correctly:  

- **Windows:** Use backslashes (`\`)  
  Example: `Playroomkit\modules\PlayroomMockBridge.js`  
- **macOS/Linux:** Use forward slashes (`/`)  
  Example: `Playroomkit/modules/PlayroomMockBridge.js`  
</Callout>
