# Persistent Storage in Playroom

ðŸ’° This API is a pro feature and currently in Free Trial.

Playroom State is cleared when all players leave the room. For some types of games, you may want to persist some data in your room that can be retrieved later when the player comes back to the same room.

Playroom provides a simple persistent storage API. The data is stored in the room until it is explicitly deleted or the expiry time is reached.

## Usage

### Create room with persistent storage enabled

```javascript
await insertCoin({persistentMode: true});
```

### Store data in the room

```javascript
await setPersistentData('somekey', {foo: 'bar'});
```

### Retrieve data from the room

```javascript
const data = await getPersistentData('somekey'); // {foo: 'bar'}
```

### Delete data from the room

```javascript
await setPersistentData('somekey', undefined);
```

### Insert Data into an Array

```javascript
await insertPersistentData('somekey', 'value1');
await insertPersistentData('somekey', 'value2');
// getting the data
const data = await getPersistentData('somekey'); // ['value1', 'value2']
```

## Use Cases

Persistent storage is ideal for:
- Leaderboards and high scores
- Player progress and achievements
- Game statistics and analytics
- User preferences and settings
- Turn-based game state
- Inventory and collectibles

## Best Practices

- Keep stored data lightweight to minimize latency
- Use meaningful keys for easy data organization
- Consider data expiry for temporary storage needs
- Regularly clean up unused data to optimize performance
