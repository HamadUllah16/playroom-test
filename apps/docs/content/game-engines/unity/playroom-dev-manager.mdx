#### Getting started with the Playroom Dev Manager

PlayroomKit for Unity, when installed in your project, comes with a prefab called **PlayroomMockManager**. This is available inside the **PlayroomKit/Prefabs** folder.

Just **drag-and-drop** it into your scene. It should have two entries.

When you select **"PlayroomMockManager"**, you'll see the Playroom Dev Manager panel on the right. Here, you can:

1. Set the **Insert Coin Caller**. This is required for Playroom Dev Manager to work correctly. The "Insert Coin Caller" is simply the GameObject where InsertCoin is called in your game.
2. Choose your **Mock mode**. Learn more about it [here](./mock-mode).
3. Launch multiple players. This currently works best with Browser Bridge mock mode. More on it [here](./multiple-player-testing).
