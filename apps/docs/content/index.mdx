## Quick Start

Get started with PlayroomKit in just a few steps:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm install playroomkit
    ```
  </Tab>

    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Basic Implementation

```javascript
import { insertCoin, onPlayerJoin, myPlayer, isHost } from 'playroomkit';

// Initialize multiplayer session
await insertCoin();

// Handle new players joining
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  console.log(`${player.getProfile().name} joined the game!`);
  
  // Remove player when they leave
  player.onQuit(() => {
    console.log(`${player.getProfile().name} left the game`);
  });
});

// Check if current player is the host
if (isHost()) {
  console.log('You are the host!');
}
```

## Core Features

### Real-time State Management
Synchronize game state across all players with simple getter/setter APIs:

```javascript
// Set state that syncs to all players
myPlayer().setState('position', { x: 100, y: 200 });

// Get state from any player
const playerPosition = somePlayer.getState('position');
```

### Player Management
Handle player connections, profiles, and presence:

```javascript
onPlayerJoin((player) => {
  const profile = player.getProfile();
  console.log(`Welcome ${profile.name}!`);
  
  // Customize player avatar
  profile.color.hex; // Player's chosen color
  profile.photo; // Player's avatar image
});
```

### Room-based Multiplayer
Create private rooms or join public sessions:

```javascript
// Create a private room
await insertCoin({ 
  roomCode: 'CUSTOM-ROOM',
  maxPlayersPerRoom: 8 
});

// Share room code with friends
const roomCode = getRoomCode();
```
